# BodyForce

#### Description

The BodyForce object applies (or exerts) a force on the part to which it is parented. 
  If the magnitude of such a force is great enough, parts can begin to accelerate. 
  The force is determined by the [Force](#force-vector3) property, and is defined on the three world axes.
  See page for more information.
