# BodyGyro

#### Description


The BodyGyro object applies a torque (rotational force) on a BasePart such that it maintains a constant angular displacement, or orientation.
  This allows for the creation of parts that point in a certain direction, as if a real gyroscope were acting upon it.
  Essentially, it's the rotational counterpart to a [BodyPosition](bodyposition.md).
