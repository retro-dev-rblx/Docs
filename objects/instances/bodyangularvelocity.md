# BodyAngularVelocity

#### Description

The BodyAngularVelocity object applies a torque (or rotational force) on a BasePart such that it maintains a constant angular velocity as determined by its [AngularVelocity](#angularvelocity-vector3). This allows for the creation of parts that continually rotate. It is the rotational counterpart to a BodyVelocity. If you would like to maintain a constant angular displacement, use a [BodyGyro](bodygyro.md) instead.
