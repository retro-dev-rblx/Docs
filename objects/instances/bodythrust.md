# BodyAngularVelocity

#### Description

The BodyThrust object applies (or exerts) a force relative to the part to which it is parented at a specific location.
  It behaves similar to a BodyForce, except that this object's force applies at a specific point (BodyThrust.Location), allowing you to exert a torque (rotational force).
  To apply a force dynamically so that a part maintains a constant angular velocity, use a BodyAngularVelocity instead.
  To apply a force dynamically so that a part maintains a constant orientation (angular position), use a BodyGyro.
