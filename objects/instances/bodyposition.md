# BodyPosition

#### Description

The BodyPosition object applies a force on a BasePart such that it will maintain a constant position in the world.
  The [Position](#position-vector3) property, not to be confused with BasePart.Position, controls the target world position.
  This is the translational counterpart to a [BodyGyro](bodygyro.md). 
  If you need further control on a force applied to an object, consider using a [BodyForce](bodyforce.md) or [BodyThrust](bodythrust.md) instead.
