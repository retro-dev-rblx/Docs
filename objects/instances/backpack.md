# Backpack

#### Description

A container object that holds a Player's inventory. Any Tool in a player's Backpack will be displayed in their inventory at the bottom of their screen. Selecting Tools from the inventory will equip the Tool, moving it from the Backpack to the player's character.

The Backpack can also store Scripts and LocalScripts, which run when placed in a player's Backpack.

When a player's character spawns, the contents of the StarterPack and their StarterGear are copied into their Backpack. Once a character dies, the Backpack is removed and a new one will be created -- populating it with the contents of StarterPack and StarterGear.
